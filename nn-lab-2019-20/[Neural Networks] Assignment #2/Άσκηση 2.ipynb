However, the entry of Franco's victorious troops into the city is eminent. Fearing the bloody repression that was coming, many Republicans are fleeing the country while others are unable or unwilling to do so. Julia, a streetcar attendant and her friend, Adelina, a Red Cross worker, are also active sympathizers of the Spanish Republic. While spending an evening in a nightclub watching musicians perform, one of the last bombings of the city takes place. In those dire circumstances they befriend Blanca, whose husband Enrique is the musicians's band leader. The triumph of the Francoist troops marks a dark turning point in the lives of those who sympathized with the Republic. Canepa, one of the musicians in Enrique's band, is a Republican militant. Fearing for his life, he decides to leave the country. Blanca, Enrique's wife, gives him some money to help him on his way. Meanwhile, Julia strikes up a relationship with dapper young nationalist soldier Perico. It is rumored that there was a plot to assassinate Franco on his victorious entry into the capital, and the nationalists are seeking revenge. Although the girls have nothing to do with it, they have been targeted for their propagandistic leftist activities. The first to be arrested is Julia, who, before too long, is being sadistically tortured by the orders of Fontenla, the cold-hearted officer in charge of the interrogations. Adelina, Virtudes' co-worker, like most of the others is a member of a socialist group. She is turned in by her well-meaning father in the naïve belief that nothing serious would happened to her and that she is just wanted for questioning. Canepa and Teo are turned in by friends and neighbors and are tortured. Canepa commits suicide while under arrest. Teo has better luck and is eventually released on the condition that he has to secretly help to identify and capture his friends, sympathizers of the Republic. With Teo's help, one by one the girls are arrested, and soon they have all been jailed. Only Carmen, the youngest of the girls of the group realizes Teo's doublecrossing, but she is also arrested. Blanca also suffers the same fate. Her only crime is to have given Canepa some money. After suffering heavy police interrogations, the young group of women are eventually transferred to an overcrowded prison. The reunion of the girls in jail serves as a consolation to their dire circumstances. At one point, they even enjoy a bit of tap-dancing. Their families, including Adelina's grief-stricken father, are hoping that they would eventually be released. Blanca is worried about her small son that she was forced to leave behind. Her admirable behaviour and her serenity while in jail made her gain the respect of the woman in charge of the prison. However, their situation worsens when the group of women complain of the terrible sanitary condition for the children imprisoned with their mothers. As a protest they jointly refused to sing the praises of the Franco regime. The fate of the 13 young women is sealed when two military officers and an innocent woman are killed in cold blood by a group of leftist revolutionaries. As a punishment, the regime order the execution of some of the prisoners, though they have nothing to do with what have happened while they are in jail. A military court condemned the 48 men and 13 young women to death in less than 48 hours. Carmen, the youngest of all, is the only survivor of the group. Desolated she listens to the shots that killed her terrified friends. The final frame of the film asserts that the bulk of the content is verifiable from documentation and that the script relies heavily on actual dialogue or writings from the central characters.\"]\n","ID:  3181 | Title:  ['Rodan'] | Categories:  ['\"Monster movie\",  \"Science Fiction\",  \"Horror\",  \"World cinema\",  \"Creature Film\",  \"Japanese Movies\"'] | Summary:  [\"In the small mining village of Kitamatsu, on the outskirts of Kyushu, two miners have gone missing. The two men, Goro and Yoshi, had brawled earlier that day, and no sooner had they entered the mine then the shaft had quickly flooded. Shigeru Kawamura , head of security at the mine, heads below to investigate. There, he and the local police make a gruesome discovery: Yoshi's lacerated corpse. Above ground, a doctor examines Yoshi, and discovers the cause of death to be a series of deep gashes caused by an abnormally sharp object. As some of the miners comfort Yoshi's wailing wife, the others discuss the possibility of Goro's involvement in the death. The two had never been friends, and had physically fought that morning. Also, Goro was still missing, and could be on the run or still be hiding in the mine. Shigeru warns them not to speak of this until the police investigation begins. Outside, Shigeru meets with his fiance Kiyo , who is also Goro's sister. He comforts her, telling her that he is sure of Goro's innocence. Inside the mine, three policemen stand guard at the edge of the water, knowing if Goro tries to escape, he will surely come that way . Suddenly, they hear a splash in the flooded mine, and venture into the water. As they wade deeper into the shaft, they get more and more nervous. All of a sudden, one of the policemen begins to scream and then disappears under the water. As the men are tied together, is is not to long before another is pulled under by something beneath the surface. The last policeman quickly unties himself and flees. However, before he can escape, he is cornered and attacked by someone, or something. Soon after, his body, along with the bodies of the other two policemen, are brought up and examined. The doctor announces that they, too, were killed by a sharp object that simply sliced them apart. Later that night, the wife of one of the murdered men runs to Kiyo's house and screams threats at her through the door, as she believes that her brother, Goro, is the killer. Shigeru soon arrives and comforts her, telling her that the officers that were killed were Goro's friends, and that he had no reason to kill them. Someone else, then, killed those men. As the two sit together, the answer to the question of who, or what, murdered the men suddenly reveals itself: a gigantic creature, resembling a gigantic insect larva, enters Kiyo's home, and both Kiyo and Shigeru flee. The police enter the home, but the giant insect forces them to flee. When they regroup, they chase the creature to the top of a hill and open fire with machine guns. The monster launches its self down the hillside and grabs two officers, clutching them in its pincers as it flees. It soon drops them and quickly escapes back into the mine. When the police and Shigeru reach the injured officers, they discover that their wounds match the wounds of the murdered policemen and Yoshi. They have found the killer. Soon after, Shigeru and a group of the metro-police head back into the mine to confront the insect monster and attempt to locate Goro, dead or alive. Unfortunately, as they enter the deepest part of the mine shaft, they discover the butchered body of Goro laying on the floor of the mine. As they approach, the giant insect emerges and chases the men back up the mine shaft. Taking action, Shigeru releases the mine cart, which rolls down the shaft and collides with the insect, crushing and killing it. Shigeru and the others then venture back into the shaft and remove Goro's body. They discover a large hole in the wall that opens up into a large cave. They realize that this is the hole through which the water and the giant insect emerged. As they peek through, they are noticed by not just one, but several more giant insects. However, before the monsters can attack, the ground begins to shake, and the mine begins to cave in. Shigeru is trapped in the cave, and the police can do nothing and the mine collapses. The next day, the police investigate the recent happenings. Dr. Kashiwagi identifies the giant insect as a Meganulon, an ancient species of dragonfly larvae that had lived on the Earth millions of years earlier. As the doctor reveals his findings, an earthquake suddenly strikes the area. Rumors begin to circulate that Mt. Aso, the volcano that eclipses Kitamatsu, might be on the verge of an eruption. When the police arrive at the base of the volcano to investigate the damage caused by the earthquake, they are shocked to discover a man wandering around the epicenter. When they reach him, they discover that it is Shigeru. However, he has received a blow to the head and has lost his memory. He is even unable to recognize Kiyo. The doctors are not optimistic about his chances for recovery, but nevertheless do their best to try to help him any way that they can. Several miles away, in Kyushu, an air base receives an alert from one of their jets. The pilot has observed an unidentified flying object performing impossible maneuvers at supersonic speeds. He is ordered to pursue the object at distance, but as he follows it, the object suddenly changes course and turns around. The object then flies straight towards the jet and destroys it. Soon after, reports from all over the world come in about the UFO. The strange object is observed flying over China, Philippines and Japan, and rumors of a secret military weapon test begin to circulate. Back in Japan, a newly married couple disappear, as well as several heads of cattle around Mt. Aso. When the authorities develop the film from the newlyweds' camera, they discover a photograph of what appears to be a gigantic wing. They match the photo with a drawing of a Pteranodon, an ancient reptile thought to be extinct millions of years earlier. Although the evidence seems to point to the Pteranodon as the culprit, the theory is dismissed as being too far fetched. Meanwhile, Shigeru's treatment is progressing slowly, but no one, especially not Kiyo, is giving up. One day, as Shigeru sits silently in his hospital room, Kiyo shows him the eggs that her pet birds have lain. As one of the eggs hatches, a terrible memory returns to Shigeru: Deep within the mine, Shigeru awoke after the cave in. Suddenly, he realized to his horror that he was surrounded by hundreds of Meganulon. The creatures crawled all around the cave, having survived millions of years underground. Shigeru then looked up and was shocked to see what appeared to be a giant egg sitting right in the middle of the cave. Suddenly, the egg began to stir, and then, all of a sudden, it hatched. From out of the fractured shell emerged a gigantic, winged creature with a sharp beak and a head like a bird of prey. Shigeru watched in horror as the enormous hatchling bent over and began to eat the Meganulon. The monstrous insects that had terrorized the town and had killed his friends were now nothing more than a snack to this new creature. With all of the Meganulon gone, the giant monster spread its wings and roared... Shigeru suddenly awakens, his memory restored. As he recovers from seeing the horrifying vision, Kiyo weeps with joy. Shigeru confirms that the creature he saw did indeed resemble a pteranodon, and that it had eaten all of the Meganulon. He and a group of police and scientists once again descend into the mine and enter the cave where the egg had been. They are able to recover a fragment of the shell before a rock slide forces them to flee back to the surface. In the lab, Dr. Kashiwagi is able to determine the size of the egg and its age: 200 million years old. After amassing the evidence, Kashiwagi calls a meeting with members of the town, along with members of the Japanese Self-Defence Force to communicate his findings. He tells the men that the UFO seen flying all across the world at supersonic speeds is a gigantic pteranodon he has dubbed Rodan. The 50 meter tall monster is capable of flying at extremely fast speeds, which create a sonic boom that more than likely led to the destruction of the jet that had first observed Rodan. Kashiwagi still has no explanation as to how the creature could have transversed the globe so quickly, and why reports of sightings occurred in multiple, distant countries at the same time. As to how Rodan could have resurfaced after millions of years is also a mystery, but Kashiwagi theorizes that nuclear bomb testing, which loosened the Earth and opened cavities to long buried crevices and caves, might be the culprit. However, Kashiwagi admits that this is only a guess. Soon after, Rodan emerges from the ground near Mt. Aso, near where the beast had hatched. The creature takes flight and begins to head for Kyushu, with a squadron of the JASDF hot on his tail. They pursue Rodan over the city, and eventually succeed in forcing him into the river. The flying reptile soon emerges, but his flight speed has been cut by half. Rodan flies over the buildings at Fukuoka, and the sonic wave created in its wake literally tears the structures apart. The flying monster lands in the city and flaps its wings, and the entire city is literally pulled down by its own weight. Fires spread, and the JSDF attempt in vain to fight the creature off. The men, and the machines, are simply blown away. Just when it seems things can't get worse, the JSDF reports that another Rodan has been spotted heading towards the city. With the mystery of the spread out sightings now revealed, the second Rodan now flies over and rips apart the buildings. After leveling the city and leaving the remaining buildings in flames, the monsters Rodan fly away, leaving thousands dead. The JSDF formulate a plan to attack the Rodans. After ascertaining their location at their old nest at the base of Mt. Aso, the military plan to shell the volcano and trigger an eruption that will trap the monsters under the lava and rock. However, Kitamatsu will be completely destroyed in the attack, and the town is forced to evacuate. The army prepares for the attack. Just moments before the strike is to begin, Shigeru looks out the window to see Kiyo climbing up the hill. He runs out to meet her, and she tells him that she has come to be with him. Rather than evacuate, she has risked her life to face the danger with the man she loves. The two leave the area and return to safety, and the military begins its attack. They launch rockets and torpedoes at the mountain, and soon the volcano begins to spew smoke and lava into the sky. One of the Rodans emerges, but is soon overcome by the fumes. As the second Rodan arrives on the scene, the first loses altitude and finally falls into the stream of lava flowing down the side of the volcano. The ancient reptile begins to scream in pain as it burns alive in the lava. The military, Dr. Kashiwagi, Shigeru and Kiyo watch from a safe distance as the still flying Rodan watches its companion die in agony. Suddenly, the second Rodan descends and lands with the first in the lava, and it too begins to burn. Rather then live on alone, the creature will die with its companion. Whether they be siblings or mates, the two Rodans lie dying together in the flowing lava. Kiyo buries her head in Shigeru's shoulder and weeps, and both Kashiwagi and Shigeru watch solemnly as the two monsters, each unwilling to live without the other, die together on the slopes of the erupting volcano.\"]\n","ID:  3339 | Title:  ['Life, and Nothing More...'] | Categories:  ['\"Drama\",  \"Adventure\"'] | Summary:  [\"A film director and his son start a journey towards Koker, the place where half of the film of Where is the Friend's Home was filmed.

What is homelessness? Today in all societies the problem of homelessness can be observed. In modern countries like Britain, homeless people can be seen in big cities such as London. Despite the British government’s efforts to tackle this problem, there are about 250,000 homeless people in this country. This documentary film is emphasizing from one side, on the homelessness as an odd element in the modern society, and from another side to the homeless person himself, who represents the sufferings of mankind of our time. Many reasons contribute to becoming homeless, these include unavailability of employment opportunities, which becomes a vicious circle due to the initial problem of being homeless, domestic violence, poverty, caused by many factors including unemployment and underemployment. Increased wealth disparity and income inequality causes distortions in the housing market that push rent burdens higher, making housing unaffordable. This documentary film analyses many of these issues and problems.'] \n","\n","Recommended Movies\n","ID:  1244 | Title:  ['40 Point Plan'] | Categories:  ['\"Drama\"'] | Summary:  ['Set in 2017, TV news-magazine host David Potrero  looks back at the major changes in America and the rest of 153 allied nations after the implementation of the 40 Point Plan five years earlier.

At the core of the plan is the 2012 formation National Employment Corporation of America, led by a who\\'s who of famous celebrity billionaires--the dream team of executives. NECA solves the unemployment problem by hiring millions of American workers to use an expanded version of real technological advances to build housing, provide water, grow food and sell its many American made products in its own superstores throughout the country and around the world. What separates NECA from your average corporation is what it does with the distribution of its profits. One third of the profits go to the organization\\'s charitable efforts, particularly the health care system.

By 1980 they had succeeded and vaccination stopped. The only living samples of the virus were safely locked inside two maximum-security laboratories, one in Russia and one in the United States. Or so the world believed. In New York City on April 9, 2002, 29-year-old sales assistant Cynthia Sheldon had been feeling unwell. She brought herself to Long Island College Hospital, were she was treated by Dr. Carl Jocelyn. She had a high fever and was complaining of a headache and back pain, she had a mild rash at that time on her hands, kind of red. A routine anthrax test on Cynthia came back negative. Dr. Jocelyn did what any doctor would have done, he gave her some Tylenol and told her to drink plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest. If anything went wrong come back in a couple of days. On April 11 at 6:20 P.M. Cynthia Sheldon was brought back to the hospital. Her state had deteriorated greatly. The fever was very high and the rash she before had on her hands had spread over her body and had erupted into small pus-filled blisters that all up and down on her arms and on her face. Upon examining her further, Dr. Jocelyn found that the blisters were all over; up and down her torso, on her neck, down her throat. It obviously wasn\\'t the flu. Dr. Jocelyn didn\\'t know what it was, only that it looked highly infectious. In response, the hospital sealed off its emergency room. The speculation in the public was that it was another bioterrorist scare. For the previous six months, the Department of Health had been on heightened alert for any unusual outbreaks of disease. Dr. Sam Wiseman was the head of the New York City bioterrorism unit and he was called in to examine Cynthia Sheldon in the isolation unit. He was convinced he was looking at a case of smallpox. To establish how widespread the outbreak might be, the Department of Health immediately faxed every hospital in the city requesting information on any patients that might be showing early symptoms of the disease. Within a half an hour they were hearing about possible cases in four of the five boroughs. Fifteen of the hospitals that they heard from had not only seen such cases in the last 48 hours, but sent them home like Cynthia had been sent home. Dr. Wiseman realized that the disease was spreading in a geometric fashion; one person infects twenty and each of the twenty infects another twenty, and so on. And they don\\'t even know they\\'re infected until they become sick 10 to 12 days later at which point they\\'re infectious. By 10:00 that night over 30 suspected cases of smallpox had been identified. It would take 24 hours before the disease could be confirmed by a laboratory diagnosis, but a plan of action was needed. The mayor called a crisis meeting at the office of emergency management. Jack Hill, the director of New York City\\'s Office of Emergency Management, wanted the city to mobilize the National Guard, close down the airports and train stations, restrict movement in and out of the city, and vaccinate anybody exposed to the virus, and quarantine anybody who had contracted smallpox. Since there were only a handful of cases, no one had died and it was still not confirmed as smallpox, the other members of the meeting saw this as an overreaction that would cause panic, so Hill was voted down. As a precaution it was agreed that anyone that had been in direct contact with the suspected case should be vaccinated. No further action was deemed necessary at that stage. In Geneva the World Health Organization was checking for any smallpox outbreaks elsewhere in the world. But none had been reported. By the time New York had diagnosed its first case it was too late, the virus had moved on. Two days before Cynthia Sheldon first went to the hospital, New York businessman Mark Smits was preparing to leave for an urgent business meeting in London. Before he left, he was ill but still left for London. At 10:30 A.M. on April 8, Mark Smits checked in to his hotel in central London. When he arrived he complained of a high fever, so a hotel doctor was called. The doctor diagnosed flu and said he would check in on him the next morning. By 11:30 A.M. the following day Smits\\'s condition had deteriorated dramatically. He was immediately transferred to St. Mary\\'s Hospital in Paddington. There was clearly a public health emergency. His symptoms were closest to Ebola, Marburg virus and other hemorrhagic diseases, but at the time there was no question as to smallpox. The Kingsway Hall hotel was isolated and decontaminated. Anyone that Smits had been in contact with was quarantined and an investigation began to trace Smits\\'s movements over the past few days. The trail quickly led back to his home in New York City. By April 12, Mark Smits had died and the disease had still not been diagnosed. At 2:10 A.M. that morning the doctors heard about the possible smallpox outbreak in New York on CNN. They knew that in 3% of smallpox victims there are hemorrhagic symptoms that kill the victim. They knew they needed to find anyone that had breathed the same air as Mark Smits that day. To contain the virus, the authorities had to locate everyone at risk, vaccinate them within four days of exposure and persuade them to stay at home for 17 days, the maximum incubation for the disease. But Cynthia Sheldon in New York and Mark Smits in London were just the tip of the iceberg. Within 24 hours 38 new cases were confirmed in New York plus six further cases in three other countries. On April 13 at 8:30 A.M., the President of the United States addressed the nation with realization that the outbreak was an act of terrorism. Three days after the first case was diagnosed there was still no clue as to who had unleashed the virus and why. No one had claimed responsibilities, no witnesses, no motive. There was no common thread that tied the early cases together. What they needed to do was to track the movements of all of the initial patients at least for the first two weeks, the incubation period. On day four the investigation made its first breakthrough. The CDC in Atlanta identified the strain of smallpox as India-1; this proved that the virus originated in a Russian bioweapons lab and somehow found its way into the hands of terrorists. In the 1960s the Soviet Union was one of the driving nations behind the campaign to eradicate smallpox. But this was the height of the Cold War. Unwittingly many of the Soviet doctors were sending smallpox samples back to the Soviet military. To the generals, the eradication of the disease presented a unique opportunity. If there was no smallpox, it meant no one would be vaccinated anymore. If nobody is vaccinated a new biological weapon based on smallpox would be the most powerful and effective weapon ever created to eliminate human life. In the 1980s Dr. Ken Alibek, holding the rank of Colonel in the Soviet Army, oversaw the secret development of a massive bio-weapons program using a specially selected strain of smallpox. The major strain used in the Soviet Union was codenamed India-1. It was highly virulent and highly contagious. Although it was consistently denied to the Western world, Biopreparat, the Soviet biological weapons program, was producing deadly disease on an industrial scale. Inside their laboratories, Ebola, Tularemia, Anthrax, and Smallpox were all weaponized and then loaded into missiles to be unleashed on the West in the event of total war. The size and scope of the research and development program was enormous. Upwards of 60,000 people worked in Biopreparat alone. Large numbers of experts in every aspect of the biological sciences and microbiological, almost a generation of the most clever people, ended up in the program. In the 1980s and 1990s hundreds of tons of smallpox were stockpiled in Soviet laboratories. Real concerns existed over the security of these facilities. With the break-up of the Soviet Union, the support to the laboratories where the virus was being made diminished sharply and between a third and a half of all the scientists left the laboratories to go to many places. Because these were scientists with families and no money, you could certainly hire these people as consultants very easily at very low prices and many countries did. Samples of the virus had traveled with them. By day 7 of the epidemic in New York, the number of smallpox cases had stabilized at 62. But that was all about to change, as the epidemic was moving into its next phase. By April 18 new outbreaks were confirmed in the densely populated cities of Delhi, Tokyo, Karachi, and Moscow. Other nations took action to prevent the further spread of the disease to their shores. All Eurotunnel and ferry services between France and England were suspended. In London, the authorities were also beginning to count the cost of Mark Smits legacy. They vaccinated more than 4,000 and still it slipped through the nails. In just four days, between April 18 and April 21, London saw nearly a hundred new cases. By day 11 outbreaks were confirmed in Glasgow, Manchester, Bristol, and Birmingham. The United Kingdom was in the grip of a major nationwide epidemic. A decision was made to withhold information about the size of the UK vaccine stockpile. They had only enough to vaccinate 14 million people, yet the UK had a population of 60 million people, which meant that only a quarter of the UK could be vaccinated. By refusing to go public with the figures it appeared the government had something to hide. The press immediately became suspicious and published inaccurate information and the public started to disbelieve what the British government told them. The transport and general workers unions demanded vaccinations. With almost no trucks delivering, panic buying led to food and fuel shortages. Within days London transport workers joined the protest, refusing to work unless they too receive vaccine. With the UK\\'s infrastructure unraveling, the authorities were rapidly losing their grip on the epidemic. On day 12 Cynthia Sheldon died and by that time there were 202 cases in New York City. Within the first ten days things went from 10 reported cases a day to 20 reported cases a day to 150 cases a day. As fear turned to panic, tens of thousands of New Yorkers had begun to flee the city. But by then outbreaks were occurring all over the United States. Suddenly every state was clamoring for vaccine. There was only one solution: to dilute the existing stockpile. They could dilute the vaccine five times safely. Although some said they could dilute it ten times, five was chosen because that was what was needed and they wanted the vaccine to be as potent as possible. But it wasn\\'t that simple. The amount of vaccine given to a recipient depended on how the vial was held, and the way it was usually held meant people received more than they should. This meant that although one vial may be meant for 100 people, doctors were lucky if they vaccinated 50 with that vial. Even where vaccine was available for many it had serious side-effects. Pregnant women, anyone with a chronic skin condition or an immune deficiency disease like AIDS couldn\\'t take the vaccine. In many cases it could kill them. There is a preparation called vaccinia immune globulin, or VIG, which is antibodies taken from the serum of people who have been vaccinated and given to people who can\\'t take the vaccine. It\\'s a very painful series of intramuscular injection taken over two days, and there were only 700 courses of it throughout the United States. In New York, because the hospitals were overwhelmed with smallpox victims and couldn\\'t deal with the daily routines they needed to deal with, the authorities created special hospitals. They took the armories throughout the city and turned them into smallpox hospitals. Thousands of beds were set up inside each building in preparation of the anticipated cases. The hospitals were manned by volunteer health workers and the National Guard was posted on the perimeter to prevent anyone from getting out. By April 29 a hundred people had died. Each body was still infectious, making it impossible to return the victims to their families. As the dead increased it became apparent they weren\\'t going to be able to deal with it in a conventional manner in the city morgues. So they took over Governors Island and turned it into a morgue. And they took Army issue air conditioned tents and every morning when the bodies were collected from the hospitals, they were taken to Governors Island and laid out and they filled one tent and another tent, etc. As more and more people avoided coming into the city, Wall Street, the world\\'s greatest financial district, fell silent. In just over two weeks, New York had ground to a halt. By day 16 there were still no clues as to who had unleashed the virus. But the date of the attack had been pinpointed: April 1, 2002. A pattern started to emerge. Among the early cases, there were two groups. The first group had traveled on the subway, between Wall Street and Grand Central Terminal, between 7:30 and 8:30 in the morning. The second group were in or around Penn Station between 8:30 and 9:30. So clearly and without a doubt the killer had targeted these sections of the city. The FBI pulled thousands of hours of CCTV footage in the target area with ten separate teams working 24 hours a day scanning the footage, frame by frame. Best of all, some of the survivors had described seeing an extremely ill man coughing on the subway. By day 21 as news of the suspect was broadcast, the next phase of infections had begun. By the first day of May, over 30 countries were fighting outbreaks. International trade and transport slowed to a trickle. Many nations without vaccine had to take harsh action to quell panic and contain the outbreaks. Every country was increasingly left to fend for itself. In the US, the number of cases was rising by a thousand a day. Strict rationing of vaccine led to riots, the worst was in south central Los Angeles, where six suspected were reported. Officials, however withheld vaccine because the suspected outbreak remained unconfirmed. The government was accused of racial discrimination in its vaccination policy. In London, life moved behind closed doors. As fear and panic took hold, random acts of violence broke out. People all over the world turned their fear and suspicion on each other. By day 36, in the UK it was clear that the measures taken by the authorities to contain both the spread of the disease and public panic were failing. Draconian measures were needed, armed troops enforced a curfew on the streets of London. The British government set up special quarantine centers around the country with the help of the Army. With smallpox outbreaks in over 36 states, the American government was also forced to introduce harsh containment and quarantine measures. By May 19 the number of cases in the UK had risen to 13,000. Five weeks after the virus had been released in New York, a man fitting the description of the suspect had was identified on CCTV footage from the target locations. Between 7:54 A.M. and 9:47 A.M. he was captured on over 20 different cameras, then he vanished. But on the 40th day of the investigation, an extraordinary discovery was made. A maintenance worker at a subway station literally tripped over a body that had been tucked into an alcove in a service tunnel. Even though it was vastly decomposed and half eaten by rats, the FBI knew who it was because of the clothes. The forensic examination concluded that the body was heavily infected with smallpox over a week before the outbreak began. But it wasn\\'t the virus that killed him, the cause of death was an overdose of barbiturates. Although the killer had taken great care to conceal his identity, the corpse provided the FBI with its first substantial leads. By late May smallpox epidemics were taking hold in Africa, South America and Asia. One of the worst hit cities was Bombay; within a week the number of cases leaped from 3,000 to 18,000. Medical staff were staying away from hospitals and millions were fleeing the city. No one had ever seen smallpox spread this fast before. What compounded the problem is that in the years since assumed eradication, AIDS had become a problem in many of these countries, which made it doubly horrible. In many parts of Africa nearly a quarter of the population was HIV-positive. Because of their weakened immunity smallpox was nearly always fatal. By day 46, there were 100,286 cases in New York City, with 12,310 dead. As the number of smallpox cases exploded, it become almost impossible to keep track of the epidemic. In New York, no one was left untouched by the nightmare. Families were ripped apart. By June 4, there were 509,013 cases in the United States, with 76,005 dead. In the UK, the management and distribution of vaccine was becoming more efficient. By the beginning of June the vast majority of the planet was caught in a disaster of biblical proportions. People fled the cities to get away from smallpox and were put into huge refugee camps, which were breeding grounds for the virus. Nobody was farming or transporting foods, so the whole infrastructure of these countries had collapsed. And people were ravaged by famine, typhoid, dysentery, cholera, plague, all mitigating against them. By mid-June 2002, the death toll in the Third World was rising by 200,000 a week. On day 65, America had over a million cases of smallpox. By then substantial quantities of new vaccine were becoming available, but its management and distribution were fraught with problems. The health infrastructure was in chaos; just getting the vaccine to the people who really needed it was a desperately difficult thing. The country was virtually on its knees by that stage. But the tide was turning. The combination of harsh containment measures and mass vaccination was reducing the spread of the disease. By mid-July the figure of 100,000 were infecting 90,000. By July 10, 2002 , there were 27,456 fatalities in New York City, however the rate of smallpox infections dropped for the first time. Every known fact about the day the epidemic began has been documented in detail. At 7:54 A.M. on April 1, the killer walked into a grocery store on the corner of Spring and Lafayette. He purchased two bottles of water, walked out of the building and onto the subway. At 8:32 A.M. in front of Grand Central Station the killer was seen crossing a crowded intersection, touching six-year old Jose Marco Ramirez on the head, who would die 22 days later. In a short distance the killer passed over 150 people, infecting 10 of them. A receipt from a jeweler\\'s found in Mark Smits\\' wallet placed him at the scene at that time. Smits was one of those ten. AT 8:33 A.M. the killer entered the Cosley building and stepped into the elevator. He rode to the top floor and then back down into the lobby where he exited the building. Cynthia Sheldon then stepped into the elevator. The FBI did not find a single hard piece of evidence that would link him to anybody. The clue that they found what he wanted them to find. They found a key on him. The key led to an apartment where the rent had been paid three months in advance. On the table lay a copy of the King James Bible. It was opened at the Book of Ezekiel. A single passage  was marked, \"A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them. Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted.\" Beyond this ambiguous message, the investigation failed to discover a motive for the attack. To this day no evidence linking the terrorist to a known organization has been established. The case remains open. By the time the global pandemic ended, 30,000 people had died in New York City, 1.5 million died in the United States, and 60 million people died worldwide. Outbreaks of smallpox are still occurring in parts of Africa and Asia. A new global eradication program has begun, but the social and psychological wounds of the great smallpox pandemic of 2002 will be much harder to heal.']\n","ID:  4344 | Title:  ['Butterfly Circus'] | Categories:  ['\"Short Film\"'] | Summary:  ['In the 1930s America is suffering for the Great Depression.

The film\\'s protagonist, Sengbe Pieh , most known by his Mende name, \"Cinqué\" , painstakingly picks a nail out of the ship\\'s structure and uses it to pick the lock on his shackles. Freeing a number of his companions, Cinquè initiates a rebellion on board the storm-tossed vessel. In the ensuing fighting, several Africans and most of the ship\\'s crew are killed, except Ruiz and Montez, the owners of the ship, who the Africans believe can sail them back to West Africa. After six weeks have passed, the ship is running out of food and fresh water, and Cinquè is growing angry with Yamba who believes keeping the Spaniards alive is the only way to get back to Africa. The next day, they sight land. Unsure of their location, a group of them take one of the ship\\'s boats to shore to fetch fresh water. While there, La Amistad is found by a military vessel bearing an American flag — the Spaniards have tricked the Africans by sailing directly for the United States. Captured by the Americans, the Amistad Africans are taken to a municipal jail in New Haven, Connecticut, where the ship\\'s occupants, and a tearful Cinquè, are thrown into a grim dungeon, awaiting trial. The film\\'s focus now shifts to Washington,\\xa0D.C., introducing John Quincy Adams , the elderly former President and sitting member of the U.S. House of Representatives. While strolling in the gardens, Adams is introduced to two of the country\\'s leading abolitionists: the elderly freed slave Theodore Joadson  and Christian activist Lewis Tappan , both of whom are leading shipping magnates in New England and co-proprietors of the pro-abolitionist newssheet \"The Emancipator\". The two have heard of the plight of the Amistad Africans and attempt to enlist Adams to help their cause. Adams, apparently verging on senility, refuses to help, claiming that he neither condemns nor condones slavery. News of the Amistad incident also reaches the current President of the United States, Martin Van Buren , who is bombarded with demands for compensation from the Spanish Queen Isabella II . At a preliminary hearing in a district court, the Africans are charged with \"insurrection on the high seas\", and the case rapidly dissolves into conflicting claims of property ownership from the Kingdom of Spain, the United States, the owners of the slaves and of La Amistad, and the American captain and first mate of the vessel responsible for re-capturing the slave-ship. Aware that they cannot fight the case on moral grounds, the two abolitionists enlist the help of a young attorney specializing in property law: Roger Sherman Baldwin . At the jail, Baldwin and the abolitionists, along with Josiah Willard Gibbs,\\xa0Sr., a professor of linguistics, attempt to talk to the Amistad Africans, but neither side is able to understand anything the other party says. In the prison, events among the Africans are accelerating. Yamba, Cinquè\\'s apparent rival for authority amongst the Africans, has become interested in Christianity, what he thinks is the way things happen spiritually and is now resigned to his death, believing that execution will send them to a pleasant afterlife. The death of one of the Africans provokes them into a furious demonstration against the American authorities, screaming and chanting in their native language. As the hearings drag on, Baldwin and Joadson approach Adams for advice. Adams advises them that, in court, the side with the best story usually wins. He then asks them what their story is. Unable to answer, they decide that their priority must be to find a way to communicate with the Africans. They begin to walk round the city docks, counting numbers in the Mende language. They find a black sailor in the Royal Navy, James Covey . Using Covey as a translator, Baldwin and his companions are able to talk to Cinquè. In his first speaking role in the courtroom, Cinquè, through a series of flashbacks, tells the haunting story of how he became a slave. Cinquè, a peasant farmer and young husband and father in West Africa, was kidnapped by African slave-hunters and taken to the slave fortress of Lomboko, an illegal facility in the British protectorate of Sierra Leone. There, he and hundreds of other captured Africans were loaded onto the transatlantic slave-ship . Cinquè tells of the various horrors of the Middle Passage, including frequent rape, horrific torture and random executions carried out by the crew including the deaths of fifty people deliberately drowned by being thrown in the ocean. Upon their arrival in Cuba, Cinquè was sold at a slave market and purchased, along with many other Tecora survivors, by the owners of La Amistad. Once aboard La Amistad, Cinquè was able to free himself of his shackles and began the slaves\\' rebellion for freedom. The courtroom drama continues as District Attorney William S. Holabird  and Secretary of State John Forsyth  press their case for property rights and dismiss Cinquè\\'s story as a mere piece of fiction. While exploring the impounded vessel La Amistad for much-needed evidence to support the Africans\\' claims, Baldwin happens upon a notebook, stuffed into a crevice by Ruiz and Montez to conceal the evidence of illegal slave-trading. Using the book as hard evidence of illegal trading, Baldwin calls expert witnesses including Captain Fitzgerald , a British naval officer assigned to patrol the West African coastline to enforce the British Empire\\'s anti-slavery policies. As Fitzgerald is cross-examined by the haughty Holabird, tension in the courtroom rises, ultimately prompting Cinquè to leap from his seat and cry \"Give us free\" over and over, a heartfelt plea using the English he has learned. Cinquè\\'s plea touches many, including the judge and in a court ruling, Judge Coglin  dismisses all claims of ownership. He then rules that the Africans were captured illegally and were not born on plantations; orders the arrest of the Amistads owners on charges of slave-trading; and authorizes the United States to convey the Amistad Africans back to Africa at the expense of the nation. While Cinquè, Joadson, Baldwin, and the jubilant Africans celebrate their victory, a state dinner at the White House threatens to overturn the ruling. While conversing with the Spanish Ambassador to Washington, Senator John C. Calhoun  launches into a damning diatribe aimed at President Van Buren, emphasizing the economic importance of slaves in the South, and ends his tirade with a concealed but clear threat that should the government set a precedent for abolition by releasing the Amistad Africans, the South will have little choice but to go to war with the North. With his advisors warning that the Amistad incident could bring the United States one big step closer to civil war, President Van Buren orders that the case be submitted to the Supreme Court, dominated by its Southern slave-owning judges. Furious, Mr. Tappan splits with Joadson and Baldwin, who break the news to an enraged and disgusted Cinquè. In need of an ally with legal background in the intricacies of Supreme Court workings, Baldwin and Joadson meet again with John Quincy Adams, who has been following the case carefully. Adams, aware that Cinquè is now refusing to talk to Baldwin, invites the African leader to his home. While Adams gives him a rambling tour of his greenhouse, Cinquè\\'s emotional reaction to seeing an African violet, native to his homeland, convinces Adams to assist the case. During preparations for the Supreme Court hearing, Cinquè tells Adams that he is invoking the spirits of his ancestors. This makes a strong impression upon Adams, presumably because he thinks of his own father, President John Adams, one of America\\'s founding fathers. At the Supreme Court, John Quincy Adams gives a long and passionate speech in defense of the Africans. He argues that if Cinquè were white and had rebelled against the British, the United States would have exalted him as a hero; and that the Africans\\' rebellion to gain their freedom was no different to the Americans\\' rebellion against their oppressors some seventy years earlier. Arguing that condemning the Amistad Africans would render the principles and ideals of the Constitution worthless, he exhorts the judges to free the Africans. He tells the court how, before the hearing, his client invoked the spirit of his ancestors. Adams then invokes the spirits of America\\'s founding fathers, including his own father. In a poignant shot, the camera frames Adams with the marble bust of his father behind him. Adams invokes the Declaration of Independence. He concludes by arguing that, if a verdict in his favor should hasten a civil war, that war will simply be the final battle of the American Revolution. His case made, the United States awaits the Supreme Court\\'s ruling. On the day of judgment, Justice Joseph Story  announces the Supreme Court\\'s decision on the case. Because the Amistad Africans were illegally kidnapped from their homes in Africa, United States laws on slave ownership do not apply. Furthermore, since that was the case, the Amistad Africans were within their rights to use force to escape their confinement. The Supreme Court authorizes the release of the Africans and their conveyance back to Africa, if they so wish. Legally freed for the second and final time, Cinquè bids emotional farewells to his companions; shaking Adams\\'s hand, giving Joadson his lion tooth which is his only memento of Africa and thanking Baldwin in English and in Mende.

Despite the British government’s efforts to tackle this problem, there are about 250,000 homeless people in this country. This documentary film is emphasizing from one side, on the homelessness as an odd element in the modern society, and from another side to the homeless person himself, who represents the sufferings of mankind of our time. Many reasons contribute to becoming homeless, these include unavailability of employment opportunities, which becomes a vicious circle due to the initial problem of being homeless, domestic violence, poverty, caused by many factors including unemployment and underemployment. Increased wealth disparity and income inequality causes distortions in the housing market that push rent burdens higher, making housing unaffordable.

But the family is greeted by a series of small trivial incidents such as milk getting spoiled that could be regarded as inauspicious but are shrugged off by the excited Manohar. The lift in the apartment does not operate for Manohar. The women in the family get hooked on to a new TV show Yavarum Nalam . The show is about a family eerily similar to theirs who have also just moved into a new house just like they have. As the serial unfolds, Manohar notices that the incidents that happen in the serial are a reflection of what has happened to Manohar and his family. The serial mirrors Manohar's family life. For example, his sister graduating first-class, his wife getting pregnant and later suffering a miscarriage. The rest of the family remains oblivious to the similarities and Manohar prefers it that way to avoid panic. He also notices that his camera will take twisted pictures of him while he is in the apartment, but not while he is out of the apartment. As Manohar fights the uneasy feeling in his mind, things start taking a turn for the worse in the serial. He is now terrified that the same might happen to his family as well. Manohar now wants to know who is behind the making of this serial and what their intentions are. As Manohar explores the mysterious happenings, he unravels a deep and unholy secret. The house they live in was the house where a whole family of eight were murdered way back in 1977. It was the family of a TV news reader named Chitra. On the day of Chitra's engagement an ardent fan  of Chitra wanted to stop the engagement and he failed in doing so. Disheartened, he committed suicide. Subsequently, all members of that family were murdered with a hammer in a single day. The blame rested on the crazy brother in the family, as he had been seen with the hammer last. The police officer investigating the case also committed suicide by hanging himself in the same house. Now Manohar and his friend, Shiva , who is a policeman, are in the process of unraveling the mystery. Manohar researches the madman Senthil/Ashok, who apparently goes crazy after seeing the TV show in an asylum. Manohar then meets Senthil, who extends a hand for Manohar but drags him inside, but his friend Shiva keeps him from being dragged. They then met Chitra's former fiance Ramchandar, who tries to plead for Senthil's innocence because he got covered in blood while he hugged the bodies, failed in the case. After researching one night, Manohar has a nightmare of the 13B murderer climbing the stairs to kill his family. When Manohar tries to climb the stairs, he always ends up on the 2nd floor and after a few moments he wakes up. He then goes to the hall and witnesses the climax of Yavarum Nalam/Sab Kheriyat when they are showing the murderer's identity; he sees two hammers, one pointed hammer and a blunt sledge-hammer, then showing Manohar's face as the killer. What follows is the climax that ties up all the loose ends. The 13B murderer is Dr Balu/Dr Shinde, who sees the family members' faces as serial family members.It was he who killed them in 1970's on the behalf of his brother and also killed the police officer who caught him red-handed.

The action then moves forward in time showing the ship, HMS Torrin, engaging German transports in a night-time engagement during the Battle of Crete in 1941. However when dawn breaks, the destroyer comes under aerial attack from German bombers. Eventually the little ship receives a critical hit following a low-level pass. The crew\\'s company abandon ship as it rapidly capsizes. Some of the officers and ratings manage to find a Carley float as the survivors are intermittently strafed by passing German planes. From here, the story is told in flashback using the memories of the men on the float. The first person to reveal his thoughts is Captain Kinross , who thinks back to the summer of 1939 when the Royal Naval destroyer HMS Torrin is being rushed into commission as the possibility of war becomes a near certainty. The ship\\'s company spends a relatively quiet Christmas in the north of Scotland during the Phoney War. But by 1940, the Torrin is taking part in a naval battle off the coast of Norway. However during the action, a young terrified sailor  leaves his station, while another rating  returns to work his gun after its crew is knocked unconscious by a torpedo strike on the ship. With the Torrin damaged it is towed back to port, all the time being harried by fighter-bombers. Safely back in harbour, Captain Kinross tells the assembled ship\\'s company that during the battle nearly all the crew performed as he would expect; however one man didn\\'t. But he tells everyone present they may be surprised to know that he let him off with a caution as he feels as Captain he failed to make the young man understand his duty. The film then returns to the present as the survivors watch the capsized Torrin slowly take on water. It becomes clear that the badly-damaged ship will sink. Once again, the raft is strafed by German planes. Some men are killed, and \"Shorty\" Blake  is wounded. This leads to a flashback in which Mills remembers how he met his wife-to-be, Freda, on a train while on leave. It is also revealed, she is related to the Torrins affable Chief Petty Officer Hardy . When the men return to sea, Freda moves in with CPO Hardy\\'s wife and mother-in-law. The Torrin participates in the Dunkirk evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force, . Meanwhile the nightly Blitz is taking its toll on British towns. Blake gets a letter from home to say that Freda has given birth to his son during a raid. However the letter goes onto tell him that Hardy\\'s wife and her mother were killed in the same attack. Stoically he goes up to the Petty Officers Mess and tells Hardy the bad news. The flashback ends as the survivors on the life raft watch the capsized Torrin finally sink. Captain Kinross leads a final \"three cheers\" for the Torrin when suddenly another passing German plane rakes the raft with machine gun fire killing and wounding more men. Soon after, a British destroyer appears and begins to rescue the men. On board, Captain Kinross talks to the survivors and collects addresses from the dying. He tells the young man who once left his post that he will write and tell the boy\\'s parents that he did his duty; the critically injured young man smiles and passes away peacefully. From here, the stories run concurrently until the end of the film. Telegrams are sent to relatives informing them about the fate of their husbands, sons and fathers. Captain Kinross and the 90 surviving members of the crew are taken to Alexandria in Egypt. Wearing a mixture of odd clothing and standing in a military depot, Captain Kinross tells them that although they lost their ship and many friends, who now \"lie together in 1500 fathoms\", he notes that these losses should inspire them to fight even harder in the battles to come. The ship\\'s company is then told they are to be broken up and sent as replacements to other ships that have lost men. Captain Kinross then shakes hands with all the ratings as they leave the depot. When the last man goes, the emotionally-tired captain turns to his remaining officers, silently acknowledges them and walks away. An epilogue then concludes: bigger and stronger ships are being launched to avenge the Torrin; Britain is an island nation with a proud, indefatigable people; Captain Kinross is now in command of a battleship. It fires its massive main guns against the enemy.']\n","ID:  2759 | Title:  ['Cruise Cat'] | Categories:  ['\"Comedy\",  \"Children\\'s/Family\"'] | Summary:  [\"Tom is a mascot aboard a cruise ship and is warned by the captain that Tom will be replaced if a mouse is found on board the ship.

Chaney acts on the investment advice and becomes wealthy overnight. Chaney rents a fancy penthouse apartment and buys a sports car. Don the horse returns to the city and feigns illness. Chaney feels sorry for him and the two become roommates in the apartment. Don\\'s father dies, but not before impressing upon Don the importance of producing an heir to the \\'chosen\\' line of talking horses. Conveniently, Don meets a beautiful white horse named Satin Doll at the stables soon after and develops a crush on the mare. Inconveniently, Satin Doll is a recent gift from Sawyer to his girlfriend. Chaney\\'s successes continue, and Sawyer asks his secretary Allison  to find out Cheney\\'s secrets. She and Cheney go on an awkward date where a smitten Cheney naively reveals that Don is the source of his investing prowess. She assumes he is being facetious. Cheney insists Don can speak and returns to his apartment with her. Don refuses to talk. Don throws a wild party at the apartment with several species of animals in attendance; the apartment is damaged. Chaney becomes angry with Don and their relationship begins to sour. After eating delicious oats, Don suggests Chaney buy stock in the company. Despite being upset, Chaney takes Don\\'s advice once again. The stock tip is a bust - the oats are contaminated and Don becomes ill. Sawyer learns of the oat company\\'s impending collapse before Chaney and locks Chaney in the office bathroom before he can unload the doomed stock. Chaney is financially devastated. Allison learns of Sawyer\\'s actions and quits her job in protest. As she leaves the office, Don speaks to her for the first time. Realizing Chaney was telling the truth about Don, Allison transports the horse to reunite with Chaney. The three work together to get revenge on Sawyer. The plan is to enter Don in a horse race against Sawyer. Chaney goads an arrogant Sawyer into betting his horses against Don. Victory will win Cheney all of Sawyer\\'s prized equines, including Don\\'s love interest Satin Doll. Unable to find an adequate jockey, Don  will be ridden by an inexperienced Chaney. While having second thoughts the night before the race, Don is visited by his father who has been reincarnated as a horse fly. Despite informing Don that \"it sucks\" being in his new form, Don\\'s father delivers a rousing pep-talk and Don\\'s confidence is restored. Don is slow out of the gate. Against all odds, Don miraculously not only catches up to his competitors, but then fast-talks all but one of the other horses into abandoning the race through a series of humorous ruses. The exhausted Don now trails a final challenger named Lord Kensington, the horse of Sawyer. Chaney struggles to motivate Don to overtake the leader. Finally, the promise of getting teeth cosmetically capped spurs extra speed out of Don and he wins in a photo-finish. The judges note that Don stuck his teeth out over the finish line first. Sawyer is humiliated. Don gets Satin Doll while Chaney gets Allison and the film finishes happily.']\n","ID:  2835 | Title:  ['The Black Stallion'] | Categories:  ['\"Adventure\",  \"Family Drama\",  \"Sports\",  \"Drama\",  \"Film adaptation\",  \"Family Film\"'] | Summary:  [\"In the summer of 1946, Alec Ramsay  is traveling aboard the steamer Drake off the coast of North Africa, when he sees a wild black stallion being heavily restrained by ropes leading to his halter and forced into a makeshift stable on the ship. Captivated by the sight of the animal, he later returns and feeds it some sugar cubes, but is caught by the supposed owner, who shoves him away, telling him in Arabic to stay away from Shetan . Later, in their stateroom, Alec's father shows him the objects he won in a card game. He gives him a pocket knife and a small statue of Bucephalus, Alexander the Great's horse, from the loot and tells him the story of how Alexander became Bucephalus' master. Later that night, he is thrown from his bunk by the violent rocking of the ship. Emerging on deck, he finds that it has caught fire and is sinking. In the chaos, he sees the black stallion trapped and manages to free him with his knife. It then jumps overboard into the sea. Alec himself is thrown overboard. Trying to stay afloat in the water, he swims toward the horse and manages to grab hold of its restraints just as the ship explodes. Alec awakens alone on the shore of an uninhabited island. At first he is sad and frightened. Exploring, he comes upon the horse, trapped again by his ropes which have become caught in some rocks. Once more he manages to free it, but it runs away. He discovers means to survive by catching fish and gathering seaweed. One morning he awakens to find himself eye to eye with an angry cobra. He is paralyzed with fear. Suddenly the horse appears and tramples it, saving his life. It then runs off again. Alec decides to try to get closer to the horse. He offers him some seaweed. It struggles with his distrust of humans, but the act of taking the food from the boy's hand seals the bond between them. They play together, running and swimming. Finally he mounts him, and after several attempts to stay on, he rides him and the two gallop together over the island, united as one. One day a Portuguese fishing ship arrives.

Spooked by the traffic in the street, he flees through the town. Alec gives chase but finally loses track of him. The next day, he meets an elderly horse owner named Snoe  who tells him where The Black is. He finds him in the barn of Henry Dailey , a retired jockey. He vigorously asserts his ownership of him, but Henry attempts to claim him himself, having spent all night trying to catch him. But when he sees the bond between the two, he realizes that he really does belong to Alec. Eating breakfast in Henry's kitchen, Alec looks out the window to where The Black is standing and realizes that he is at home on the farm. Henry offers Alec the use of a stall in which to keep him.

Noting his skill with explosives, Juan relentlessly tries to make him join a raid on the Mesa Verde national bank. John in the meantime has made contact with the revolutionaries and intends to use his dynamite in their service. The bank is hit as part of an orchestrated revolutionary attack on the army organized by Doctor Villega . Juan, interested only in the money, is shocked to find that the bank has no funds and instead is used by the army as a political prison. John, Juan and his family end up freeing hundreds of prisoners, causing Juan to become a \"great, grand, glorious hero of the revolution\". The revolutionaries are chased into the hills by an army detachment led by Colonel Günther Reza . John and Juan volunteer to stay behind with two machine guns and dynamite. Much of the army\\'s detachment is destroyed while crossing a bridge which is machinegunned by them and blown to bits by John. Col. Reza who commands an armoured car, survives. After the battle, John and Juan find most of their comrades, including Juan\\'s family and children, have been killed by the army in a cave. Engulfed with grief and rage, Juan goes out to fight the army singlehanded and is captured. John sneaks into camp where he witnesses executions of many of his fellow revolutionaries by firing squad. They had been informed on by Dr. Villega, who has been tortured by Col. Reza and his men. This evokes in John memories of a similar betrayal by Nolan , his best friend, whom John kills for informing.

They learn that Pancho Villa\\'s forces will be delayed by 24 hours and that an army train carrying 1,000 soldiers and heavy weapons, led by Col. Reza, will be arriving in a few hours, which will surely overpower the rebel position. John suggests they rig a locomotive with dynamite and send it head on. He requires one other man, but instead of picking Juan, who volunteers, he chooses Dr. Villega. It becomes clear to Villega that he knows of the betrayal. John nonetheless pleads with him to jump off the locomotive before it hits the army\\'s train, but Villega feels guilty and stays on board. John jumps in time and the two trains collide, killing Villega and a number of soldiers.

The beginning of the plot mainly focuses on the Nakaoka family\\'s struggle to survive as shortages of food and other items continue to worsen throughout Japan. Like the other residents, the family wonders why Hiroshima has so far suffered only minor damage; since massive fleets of American B-29 Superfortress bombers have already devastated nearly all of Japan\\'s other major cities. Gen and Shinji try and help their family by working tirelessly in the family\\'s wheat field, or attempting to find food to feed their pregnant mother Kimie, who has grown ill from malnutrition. When a neighbor tells them Carps blood helps people with malnutrition get better, they set out to get a carp...from an old man\\'s pond. When the boys get caught stealing the fish, the old man hits Gen. Gen tells the man he can hit him all he wants if the old man lets them keep the carp, and Shinji says the old man can hit him, too. When the old man asks why they want the carp so bad, they explain that their mother needs it or she might die. The old man, who is impressed by their efforts, allows them to keep the carp for their mother. On the night of August 5, the family is awakened by an air raid and take refuge in their bomb shelter, though, after some time, it is clear this is yet another false alarm. During the ordeal, Gen\\'s father Daikichi again questions why American aircraft are constantly flying over Hiroshima without dropping any bombs, and expresses his fear that Hiroshima is being saved for some special purpose. The next morning, Shinji shows his Father a wooden boat Gen made for him, and tells his Father that Gen promised to take him to the river to set it afloat after he returns from school. Gen leaves his home around 7:40 in the morning. Upon reaching his school, Gen takes notice of a single passing B-29 aircraft passing far overhead, and discusses with a female friend that no alarms are being sounded because a single plane cannot possibly pose any significant threat. As this occurs, his father, sister, and brother watch and discuss as an army of ants enters their home in large numbers, while his mother hangs clothes on a clothesline on a second-floor balcony of the house. Gen, who is tossing a pebble up and down, drops it and bends over to pick it up. Suddenly, the town is blinded by a white flash. Gen\\'s friend get burned, people\\'s eyes fall out of their heads as people burn up. Gen\\'s father, sister and brother are buried by their collapsing home, and Gen\\'s mother falls from the balcony. Gen is protected from the direct blast because he was bent down on the other side of a stone wall, but does get blown back and buried under some rubble. Several explicit and dramatic scenes throughout Hiroshima show the effects of the explosion, as buildings are destroyed and people are literally evaporated. After the explosion scene ends, a long sequence documenting the immediate horrors of the bomb begins: including the death of his friend, his horror at the enormous destruction of the city surrounding him, and the sight of deformed and extremely burned people wandering the streets. Gen wonders out loud if they are ghosts, since it is hard to tell if they are dead or alive. Gen\\'s mother has survived with only minimal injuries, but Gen\\'s father, sister and little brother are trapped under the ruins of the house. Despite their efforts, Gen and his mother cannot rescue them, and as the fires approach, Gen\\'s father orders them to escape, while telling Gen that he must now protect his mother and her unborn child. As Gen drags his mother away, the two watch helplessly as the family home is consumed by fire, and are forced to listen to the screams of their family members as they slowly burn to death. This causes Gen\\'s Mother\\'s mind to snap momentarily and she begins to laugh in a fit of hysterics. Soon after, Gen and his mother are taken to a safer area by a neighbor, where his mother gives premature birth to a baby girl. Gen leaves to find items and a midwife but is unable to and aids in the birth himself. He notes that his little brother was wrong about what the baby\\'s gender would be, and screams  that \"She\\'s the most beautiful baby girl in the world and you don\\'t even get to see her!\" He then leaves his mother and newborn sister in search of food or help but is unable to find anyone or anything as everyone is injured or dead and everything is destroyed or on fire. Later that night, Gen is unable to sleep due to the wailing of burned survivors nearby. He and his mother decide to get up and give the people water, as they are clamoring out of thirst, only to discover that they die soon after drinking it and so stop handing the water out, as thirst was the only instinct keeping them alive. By August 8, Gen finds that soldiers have entered the city and are distributing rice, but gets there too late, only to find them collecting corpses and burning the dead. He finds a fireman\\'s hat which becomes a signature part of his character. He is later horrified to find a soldier shivering from cold in the intense summer heat, losing his hair, defecating blood, and vomiting blood. He takes the soldier to the Red Cross hospital only to find out that he is being left for dead by the doctors there, as his unknown sickness cannot be cured. Simultaneously, his mother attempts to find milk for the baby as her breasts have run dry, and clamors to find a feeding mother to give her some, only to find a baby attempting to nurse from his mother\\'s corpse. Another woman then attacks her and attempts to kill the baby, but quickly changes her mind, pointing out her baby has died and she has reacted out of despair. In her change of heart, she breastfeeds Kimie\\'s baby. After several days of wandering around for food, Gen finds a ration storehouse containing rice, only to find that most of it has been seared by the heat of the blast. After digging through and onto the lower bags in the stack, he then finds that some have not been seared and takes them to his mother to eat along with some fresh vegetables. Gen and his mother then decide to name the baby Tomoko, meaning friend Like many Japanese names, Tomoko  can be written using different kanji characters, and have several meanings, including \"friendly child,\" \"knowing child,\" \"wise child,\" or \"beautiful girl.\" as Gen hopes she will be surrounded by many friends all her life, and the two remark on the growing number of pyres being burned with the dead by soldiers. Gen and his mother then take refuge in a makeshift shack, and on August 16, dig up the skulls of their dead family members from the ruins of the former home. As they do so, a passing family informs them that the war has ended, as Japan has surrendered unconditionally to the Allied powers. Gen and his mother respond angrily; his mother furiously stating that peace has come too late, and lamenting that had their leaders ended the war just a few days earlier, Hiroshima would not have been destroyed. Soon after, Gen discovers his hair has started to fall out, and remembering the stricken soldier, panics, only to be reassured by his mother. In the shack, Gen  and his mother eat as little of the rationed rice as possible in an attempt to save it while the baby sleeps, when a small boy, Ryuta, attempts to steal the rice. Gen stops him and brings him back only to be shocked by his physical resemblance to his younger brother Shinji. After speaking with the boy and feeding him, Gen and his mother learn he is orphaned and decide to keep him with them, Gen\\'s mother stating that she would wish for someone to look after Shinji in a similar situation. The boy begins to cry, Soon after, Gen is cheered up by Ryuta who has come to call him older brother, something which makes Gen feel proud and gives him a strong connection to his new friend. The following day, Gen and Ryuta head out to find food as their sister is suffering from malnutrition due to lack of milk, and are picked up by a man from out of town who takes them to tend for his sick brother, another bomb survivor, for 10 Yen per day. The two accept and find the man they will take care of is crude, rotting, and angry, his family rejecting him and his attitude. Despite his harshness, Gen and Ryuta decide to stay and take care of him regardless. At one point they decide that the money\\'s not worth it, and slap him and call him a spoiled brat, but just as they are about to leave, the man begs them to come back, and even asks them to hit him again. The man explains to the confused boys that he never gets human contact and the only company he gets are the boys who are paid to take care of him, who usually end up leaving. The two boys were the only ones who treated him like more than a rotting corpse. Feeling sorry for him, Gen tells Ryuta to tell his mother where they are, and stays with the man. Gen even spends the night with him, inspiring him to paint once again. Due to their commitment where others hired to care for him gave up or failed, the man\\'s brother pays them 100 Yen, and the boys head out to find milk quickly, in hopes of bringing it back to feed Gen\\'s sister. Unfortunately, they arrive with the milk too late, as Tomoko has already died of malnutrition. Her body is then burned in a pyre, and Gen cries out to his father for guidance. Despite hearing that no grass would grow in Hiroshima for seventy years, Gen and Ryuta find that the wheat is starting to grow, and Gen is excited to discover his hair is also growing back. Gen remembers how his Father told them no matter how much wheat is beaten down, it always grows back, and that his sons should be like the wheat. In his new found optimism, Gen remembers the promise he made to Shinji of taking him to the river after school, and so, he builds a new wooden boat, placing a candle on to the top. Two weeks after the bomb, Gen takes Ryuta and his mother to the river, where they light the candle and release the boat, together they watch the flame in the sunset, a symbol meant to express that beyond all the terrible events and experiences of the war, lies the hope for a brighter future.']\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"0zkGIEIeeDgZ","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":190},"outputId":"c2aa897a-cc66-4249-bfbd-9eedb50448b2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1580086244229,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":7689,"user":{"displayName":"Stelios Tsagkarakis","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDOLo4FlJII2mz-3mMhNUtlpKKdC_uQaEp-IGfqgQ8=s64","userId":"13459075903445732901"}}},"source":["content_recommender(11, 5)"],"execution_count":26,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Target Movie\n","ID:  11 | Title:  ['Murder in My Mind'] | Categories:  ['\"Thriller\",  \"Science Fiction\"'] | Summary:  [\"When a serial killer preys on blondes, a blonde federal law enforcement officer investigating the case decides to take a drastic step.

Initially, he sets strict rules for himself regarding whom he should follow and for how long, but soon discards them as he focuses on a well-groomed, handsome man in a dark suit. The man in the suit, having noticed he is being followed, quickly confronts the Young Man and introduces himself as \"Cobb\". Cobb reveals that he is a serial burglar and invites The Young Man to accompany him on various burglaries. The material gains from these crimes seem to be of secondary importance to Cobb, who takes pleasure in rifling through the personal items in his targets\\' flats, and doing things such as drinking their wine. He explains that his true passion is using the shock of robbery and violation of property to make his victims re-examine their lives. He sums up his attitude thus: \"You take it away, and show them what they had.\" The Young Man is thrilled by Cobb\\'s lifestyle. He attempts break-ins of his own, as Cobb encourages and guides him. At Cobb\\'s suggestion, he alters his appearance, cutting his hair short and wearing a dark suit. The Young Man assumes the name \"Daniel Lloyd\" based on the credit card Cobb gives to him and begins to pursue a relationship with a blonde woman whose flat he and Cobb burglarized. The Blonde turns out to be the girlfriend of a small-time gangster  whom she broke up with after he murdered a man in her flat. Soon, the Blonde confides that the Bald Guy is blackmailing her with incriminating photographs. The Young Man breaks into the Bald Guy\\'s safe, but is caught in the act by an unidentified man. The Young Man bludgeons the man with a claw hammer and flees with the Bald Guy\\'s money and photos. Upon returning to his flat, he finds that the photos are innocuous modeling shots. Confronting the Blonde, the Young Man learns that she and Cobb have been working together to manipulate him into mimicking Cobb\\'s burglary methods. Cobb had recently discovered a murdered woman\\'s body during one of his burglaries, and is attempting to deflect suspicion from himself by making it appear as though multiple burglars share his MO. The Young Man leaves to turn himself in to the police. The Blonde reports her success to Cobb, who then reveals that he actually works for the Bald Guy. The story about the murdered woman was part of a plot to deceive both the Blonde and the Young Man: The Blonde has been blackmailing the Bald Guy with evidence from the murder he committed in her flat, and he wants her murdered in such a way that it cannot be connected to him. Cobb bludgeons the Blonde to death with the same claw hammer that the Young Man used during the burglary of the Bald Guy\\'s safe and leaves it at the scene. The police, checking out the Young Man\\'s story, find the Blonde murdered and the claw hammer with his finger prints on it. The Young Man is implicated for all of Cobb\\'s crimes, along with the murder of the blonde woman. Meanwhile, Cobb vanishes into a crowd.']\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"bSPonZpfeE7s","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":190},"outputId":"d2a1e324-ff48-48f6-f141-e34d6a52820a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1580086244231,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":7684,"user":{"displayName":"Stelios Tsagkarakis","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDOLo4FlJII2mz-3mMhNUtlpKKdC_uQaEp-IGfqgQ8=s64","userId":"13459075903445732901"}}},"source":["content_recommender(42, 5)"],"execution_count":27,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Target Movie\n","ID:  42 | Title:  ['The Victim'] | Categories:  ['\"Thriller\",  \"Horror\",  \"Psychological thriller\",  \"World cinema\"'] | Summary:  [\"Ting is a struggling young actress who one day is noticed by Royal Thai Police Lieutenant Te, who heads up the crimes re-enactment unit and is always on the look-out for fresh talent.

Demonic growls are heard, leaves and other street trash suddenly come flying into the church as a crucifix comes to life. It then cuts to Lieutenant William F. Kinderman  at a crime scene, where a 12-year-old boy named Thomas Kintry has been murdered. Kinderman takes his friend, a priest named Father Dyer , out to see their mutually favorite film It\\'s a Wonderful Life. Kinderman later relates the gruesome details of the murder of the young boy he was investigating that morning, including his crucifixion. Another murder soon takes place; a priest found decapitated in a church. Dyer is shortly hospitalized and found murdered the next day, with the words \"IT\\'S A WONDERFULL LIFE\" written on a wall in Dyer\\'s blood. At each murder scene, the fingerprints at the crime scenes do not match up, indicating a different person was responsible for each. Kinderman tells hospital staff the reason for his unease; fifteen years ago the vicious serial killer, \"The Gemini\" , was executed; with every victim he cut off the right index finger and carved the Zodiac sign of Gemini into the palm of their left hand. Kinderman noticed the hands of the three new victims and verified that the Gemini\\'s sign has been there. The Gemini Killer also always used an extra \"L\" in his notes sent to the media, such as \"usefull\" or \"carefull\". Furthermore, to filter out false confessions, the original Gemini Killer\\'s true mutilations were kept a secret by the Richmond police\\'s homicide department; the newspapers were made to wrongfully report that the left middle finger was severed and that the Gemini sign was carved on the back of the victim. Kinderman visits the head of the psychiatric ward, Dr. Temple ([[Scott Wilson , who relates the history of a man in Cell 11, that he was found wandering aimlessly fifteen years ago with amnesia. The man was locked up, catatonic up until recently when he began to be violent and claim to be the Gemini Killer. Kinderman sees that the patient resembles his dead friend, Father Damien Karras ([[Jason Miller . However the patient brags of being the Gemini Killer, expressing ignorance over who Father Karras is, and boasts of killing Father Dyer. The next morning, a nurse and Dr. Temple are found dead. Kinderman returns to see the patient in Cell 11, who claims to be the Gemini Killer\\'s spirit, revealing that after his execution his soul entered Karras\\'s dying body. The demon Pazuzu who had possessed the girl Regan MacNeil, was furious at being pushed out of the child\\'s body and is exacting its revenge by putting the soul of the Gemini Killer into the body of Father Karras. Each evening, the soul of the Gemini leaves the body of Karras and possesses the elderly people with senile dementia elsewhere in the hospital and uses them to commit the murders. The Gemini Killer also reveals to have forced Dr. Temple to bring Kinderman to him or he would suffer in unspeakable ways - Temple believed his apparent bluff, however, he couldn\\'t take the pressure, and so he committed suicide. The Gemini possesses an old woman who makes a failed attempt to murder Julie, Kinderman\\'s daughter. The possessed patient attacks Kinderman, but the attack abruptly ends when a priest, Father Paul Morning , enters the corridor leading to cell 11 and attempts an exorcism on the patient. It goes wrong when Pazuzu intervenes, taking over the patient\\'s body, and the priest is all but slain. Kinderman arrives in time and attempts to euthanise Karras after finding the body of the priest, only to be hurled into the wall by the possessed Karras. Father Morning manages to briefly regain consciousness and tells Karras \"Damien. Fight him.\" Karras regains his free will briefly and cries to Kinderman \"Bill, now, shoot now, kill me now--!\" Kinderman fires his revolver several times hitting Karras in the chest, fatally wounding him. The Gemini is now gone and Karras is finally free. With weak breaths he says \"We won Bill, now free me.\" Kinderman puts his revolver against Karras\\' head and fires.

Gort is reprimanded but is allowed to return to flying the Phoenix after a check flight under Captain Hugh Dallas . Meanwhile, Gort's daughter Charlotte  refuses to believe he is at fault. Gort's flying skills are again called into question when an approach to Calcutta is apparently made dangerously low, causing the aircraft to hit a hedge just before the runway threshold. It is later discovered that there was no hedge at the threshold of the Calcutta runway, and that the piece of hedge wrapped round the undercarriage leg had actually come from Ranjibad, where the aircraft had been taken off by Captain Clive Judd  - this shows that Gort is not the only pilot to have problems taking off.

At company headquarters, Kevin tells his controllers to alert the government. The USAF scrambles F-15 fighter jets to intercept the missile just as it locks onto the Concorde. An F-15 shoots down the missile before it collides with the Concorde. As the Concorde is approaching the European coastline, an F-4 Phantom sent by Harrison engages the Concorde as French Air Force Mirages scramble to help the Concorde. The Mirages shoot down the F-4 and the Concorde continues to Paris, although to Le Bourget instead of Charles de Gaulle. The Concorde reaches the French coastline, landing with a damaged hydraulic system and just barely stopping at the last safety net. Captain Metrand and Isabelle invite Joe to dinner.

He has been waiting for a week for the rain to stop so he can attempt the first successful nonstop solo transatlantic flight from New York to Paris. While Lindbergh tries to fall asleep, his friend Frank Mahoney  guards his hotel room door from reporters who have also been waiting for a break in the weather. Unable to sleep, Lindbergh reminisces about his recent days as an airmail pilot flying from St. Louis to Chicago. Flying to Chicago in winter, Lindbergh lands his old de Havilland biplane in a small airfield to refuel. Despite the bad weather, Lindbergh takes off, unaware that the Chicago landing field has closed due to snow. Lindbergh\\'s aircraft ices up and stalls, forcing him to parachute out with the mailbag. He continues his journey by train and meets a suspender salesman who tells Lindbergh that two airmen just died competing for the Orteig Prize to be awarded to the first pilots to fly from New York City to Paris , nonstop. From a diner at Lambert Flying Field in St. Louis, Lindbergh calls Columbia Aircraft Corporation in New York City, pretending to represent a group of prominent businessmen. Lindbergh is quoted the price of $15,000  for a Bellanca aircraft. For the next six weeks, Lindbergh presents his idea of entering the competition to St. Louis financiers and prominent St. Louis citizens, explaining he can cross the ocean in 40 hours in a single-engine aircraft if he strips it of all non-essential weight, allowing room for extra fuel tanks. The men are excited by Lindbergh\\'s vision and name the aircraft, Spirit of St. Louis. At the request of his backers, Lindbergh travels to San Diego, California to check out a small aircraft factory, Ryan Aeronautical Company. There he meets Mahoney, the president of the company, who promises to build him an aircraft in just 90 days. At the factory, Frank, Lindbergh, and Ryan\\'s chief engineer Donald Hall  agree on a design. To decrease weight, Lindbergh refuses to install radios or heavy equipment and plans to navigate by \"dead reckoning\" . In the race to complete the aircraft ahead of schedule, workers at the factory agree to work 24-hour shifts. Lindbergh learns that two pilots, who were vying for the Orteig Prize, were killed during their flight test. When the Ryan aircraft is complete, Lindbergh flies his new aircraft to St. Louis, and then on to New York. Unable to sleep, Lindbergh leaves his hotel room and goes to Roosevelt Field, where his aircraft is being filled with three hundred gallons of fuel. To decrease weight, he even eliminates the parachute. Because of limited space in the cockpit, the magnetic compass was placed in an awkward position. A young woman offers her mirror, which is then glued into place for the pilot\\'s view. When Lindbergh is not watching, Mahoney slips a Saint Christopher medal into the pilot\\'s lunch bag. With the weather clearing, Lindbergh and the heavy Spirit of St. Louis trundle down the muddy runway and barely clear the treetops at the end of the field. Every hour, Lindbergh switches fuel tanks to keep the weight load balanced. As he flies over Cape Cod, he realizes he has not slept in 28 hours. He remembers back to times when he slept on railroad tracks, on short bunk beds, and under a windmill. When Lindbergh begins to doze aboard the Spirit of St. Louis, he is awakened by a fly. When he flies over Nova Scotia and sees a motorcyclist below, he remembers his own Harley-Davidson, which he traded for his first aircraft, a war-surplus Curtiss Jenny. As Lindbergh flies over the seemingly endless Atlantic, he remembers barnstorming across the Midwest and performing dangerous stunts in a flying circus. At the 16th hour, as darkness descends, he worries that an engine cylinder might crack from the cold. The sight of a \"white ship\", which he soon realizes is an iceberg, is evidence that he is near the Arctic Circle. After 18 hours, the aircraft\\'s wings ice up and the engine stalls. The Spirit of St. Louis begins to drop, but the ice breaks off in the warmer air and he is able to restart the engine. Back on course, Lindbergh discovers that his compasses are malfunctionings, forcing him to navigate by the stars. By dawn, he is so tired he falls asleep, causing the aircraft to circle and descend, but sunlight reflecting off the mirror awakens him in time to regain control. After Lindbergh sees a seagull and realizes he is close to land, he tries without success to hail a fisherman below. He soon sights land and determines from map features that he has reached Dingle Bay, Ireland. As he reaches for one of his sandwiches, Lindbergh discovers the hidden Saint Christopher medal. Hanging the medal on the instrument panel, he flies on, crossing the English Channel and then up the coast of France, following the Seine to Paris. Once again the engine cuts out, from lack of fuel, but he is able to recover by switching tanks. Evening descends and Lindbergh finally sees the lights of Paris ahead of him. As he approaches Le Bourget Airfield, he is confused by the spotlights. He doesn\\'t understand that the strange movements below him are actually crowds of people. Exhausted and panicked, Lindbergh makes his descent whispering a prayer, \"Oh, God help me!\" After landing, hordes of people rush to Lindbergh, blind him with camera flashes, and carry him off triumphantly to the hangar. Tired and confused, Lindbergh eventually realizes that the crowds are cheering for his great achievement. When Lindbergh returns to New York, he is given a huge parade in his honor.']\n","ID:  2348 | Title:  ['The Blue Max'] | Categories:  ['\"Drama\",  \"War film\"'] | Summary:  ['German Corporal Bruno Stachel  leaves the fighting in the trenches to become an officer and fighter pilot in the German Army Air Service. Joining a squadron in spring 1918, he sets his sights on winning Imperial Germany\\'s highest military decoration for valor, the Pour le Mérite, nicknamed the \"Blue Max\", for which he must shoot down 20 aircraft. Of humble origins, Lieutenant Stachel is driven to prove himself better than the aristocratic pilots in his new fighter squadron, especially Willi von Klugermann . Their commanding officer, Hauptmann Otto Heidemann  is an upper-class officer whose notions of chivalry conflict with Stachel\\'s ruthless determination. On his first mission, Stachel, in a Pfalz D.III, shoots down a British S.E.5, but does not receive credit for his \"kill\" because there were no witnesses. Stachel searches the French countryside for hours in a pouring rain for the wreckage, giving the impression that he cares more about scoring kills than the death of the man with whom he flew. Soon afterward, he attacks an Allied two-man observation aircraft, incapacitating the rear gunner. Instead of downing the defenseless aircraft, he signals the pilot to fly to the German base. As they near the airfield, the wounded rear gunner revives and reaches for his machine gun, unseen by the admiring observers on the ground. Stachel is forced to shoot the aircraft down, but Heidemann believes Stachel simply murdered a helpless enemy crew to gain a confirmed kill. The incident brings Stachel to the attention of General Count von Klugermann , Willi\\'s uncle. When the general comes to the base to award his nephew the Blue Max, he meets Stachel. The general sees great propaganda potential in Stachel, one of the masses. Kaeti , the general\\'s wife, is carrying on a discreet affair with her nephew by marriage. Soon afterward, Stachel is shot down after rescuing a red Fokker Dr.I attacked by two British fighters. When he returns to the airfield, he is stunned when he is introduced to the man he saved: Manfred von Richthofen , the Red Baron. Von Richthofen offers Stachel a place in his squadron, which Stachel declines, explaining his desire to \"prove himself\" with his current squadron. With Stachel temporarily grounded owing to a minor injury, General von Klugermann orders him to Berlin to help shore up crumbling public morale. Kaeti takes the opportunity to sleep with her latest hero. When Stachel returns to duty, he and Willi von Klugermann volunteer to escort a reconnaissance aircraft. British fighters attack their Fokker Dr. 1 triplanes. Stachel\\'s guns jam, but Willi downs two of the enemy on his first pass, then a third on Stachel\\'s tail, and the rest disengage. As the two are returning to their base, Willi challenges Stachel. Spotting a bridge, Willi dives under the wide middle span, but Stachel tops him by flying under a much narrower side one. Seething, Willi does the same, but clips the top of a tower afterward and crashes. When Stachel reports his death, Heidemann assumes that the two verified victories were Willi\\'s. Insulted, Stachel impulsively claims them, even though it is discovered that he only fired 40 bullets before his guns jammed. Outraged, Heidemann reports Stachel to his superiors, but is told that Stachel\\'s victories will be confirmed. Later, alone with Kaeti, Stachel admits he lied. During a strafing mission covering the retreat of the German army, Stachel disobeys Heidemann\\'s order not to engage enemy fighters; one by one, the rest of the squadron follow him. Afterward, Heidemann has Stachel arrested, furious that nearly half the pilots were killed in the ensuing dogfight. Stachel cares only that he has shot down enough aircraft, even without Willi\\'s kills, to qualify for the Blue Max. The two men are ordered to Berlin. There, von Klugermann tells Heidemann privately that Stachel is to receive the Blue Max, explaining that the people need a hero. Heidemann resigns his command when the general orders him to withdraw his report; he accepts a desk job. Later that evening, the countess visits Stachel and suggests that they run away to Switzerland since Germany\\'s defeat is inevitable. She storms out when he refuses to give up flying. The next day, Stachel is awarded the Blue Max by the Crown Prince  in a well-publicized ceremony. However, a field marshal telephones von Klugermann to inform him of an impending investigation into Stachel\\'s false claim. The general asks how the field marshal found out. While listening on the phone, he turns to his wife. When Heidemann reports that the new monoplane he has just test-flown is a \"death trap\", as its struts are dangerously weak, von Klugermann sees a way to avoid scandal. He orders Stachel to fly the aircraft and tells him, \"Let\\'s see some real flying.\" The stress of Stachel\\'s aerobatics causes the aircraft to crash.']\n","ID:  1206 | Title:  ['Flight Angels'] | Categories:  ['\"Romance Film\",  \"Drama\",  \"Comedy film\"'] | Summary:  ['Although one of Federal Airlines \"ace\" pilots, Chick Faber  is grounded by Flight Superintendent Bill Graves  when a doctor finds his eyesight is failing.

Graves arranges for his wife to meet the newly enlisted Lt. Farber, now a flight instructor, with the reunited couple finally at peace, knowing that everything will turn out all right.The formation of the Flying Tigers is only hinted at.']\n","ID:  2658 | Title:  ['Amelia'] | Categories:  ['\"Biography\",  \"Adventure\",  \"Period piece\",  \"Drama\",  \"Romance Film\",  \"Biographical film\"'] | Summary:  ['On July 2, 1937, Amelia Earhart  and her navigator, Fred Noonan , are on the last leg of an around-the-world flight. Moving in vignettes from her early years when Earhart was captivated by the sight of an aircraft flying overhead on the Kansas prairie where she grew up, her life over the preceding decade gradually unfolds. As a young woman, she is recruited by publishing tycoon and eventual husband George Putnam  to become the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean, albeit as a passenger. Taking command of the flight results in a success and she is thrust into the limelight as the most famous woman pilot of her time. Putnam helps Earhart write a book chronicling the flight, much like his earlier triumph with Charles Lindbergh\\'s We, gradually falling in love with his charge, and they eventually marry, although she enacts a \"cruel\" pledge as her wedding contract. Embarrassed that her fame was not earned, Earhart commences to set myriad aviation records, and in 1932, recreates her earlier transatlantic flight, becoming the first female pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic. Throughout a decade of notoriety, Earhart falls into an awkward love affair with pilot and future Federal Aviation administrator Gene Vidal . In a display of romantic jealousy, Putnam quietly tells Amelia that he does not want Vidal in his house. Earhart is annoyed by the seemingly endless agenda of celebrity appearances and endorsements but Putnam reminds his wife that it funds her flying. They each acquiesce to the other\\'s wishes and Earhart is drawn back to her husband on the eve of her last momentous flight, a round the world flight fraught with perils. Earhart\\'s first attempt ends in a runway crash in Hawaii, due to collapsed landing gear. Earhart shuts off the fuel supply but her aircraft requires repairs before the flight can be attempted again. Eventually, she takes the repaired Lockheed Model 10 Electra \"Flying Laboratory\" in a reverse direction, leaving the lengthy transpacific crossing at the end of her flight. Setting out to refuel at tiny Howland Island, radio transmissions between USCGC , a Coast Guard picket ship, and Earhart\\'s aircraft reveal a rising crisis, as her fuel begins to run out. Her last message is a cryptic position report that the Coast Guard radio operators realize is not of sufficient length to provide a \"fix\". Itasca has a directional finder with a dead battery, and weak radio communications prevent Earhart and USCG Itasca from making contact. Earhart and Noonan continue to fly on, as the story ends.']\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"NPVK7Z5c1p5F"},"source":["## Επεξήγηση επιλογών και ποιοτική ερμηνεία\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"i_bXRoOLIzbE","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Για τη βελτιστοποίηση της `TfidfVectorizer`, χρησιμοποιήσαμε ορισμένες παραμέτρους προκειμένου να περιορίσουμε στις περιγραφές των ταινιών λέξεις/χαρακτήρες που διαστρέβλωναν το αποτέλεσμα.

διανυσματικής αναπαράστασης με το tf-idf και των κατηγοριών, χρειαζόμαστε ένα κριτήριο ποιοτικής επισκόπησης των clusters. Θα υλοποιήσουμε το εξής κριτήριο: Λαμβάνουμε όρισμα έναν αριθμό (ετικέτα) cluster. Για το cluster αυτό βρίσκουμε όλους τους νευρώνες που του έχουν ανατεθεί από τον k-Means. Για όλους τους νευρώνες αυτούς βρίσκουμε όλες τις ταινίες που τους έχουν ανατεθεί (για τις οποίες αποτελούν bmus). Για όλες αυτές τις ταινίες τυπώνουμε ταξινομημένη τη συνολική στατιστική όλων των ειδών (κατηγοριών) και τις συχνότητές τους. Αν το cluster διαθέτει καλή συνοχή και εξειδίκευση, θα πρέπει κάποιες κατηγορίες να έχουν σαφώς μεγαλύτερη συχνότητα από τις υπόλοιπες.

Μια πιθανή διαδικασία θα μπορούσε να είναι η ακόλουθη:\n","\n","1. Ορίζουμε συνάρτηση `print_categories_stats` που δέχεται ως είσοδο λίστα με ids ταινιών. Δημιουργούμε μια κενή λίστα συνολικών κατηγοριών. Στη συνέχεια, για κάθε ταινία επεξεργαζόμαστε το string `categories` ως εξής: δημιουργούμε μια λίστα διαχωρίζοντας το string κατάλληλα με την `split` και αφαιρούμε τα whitespaces μεταξύ ετικετών με την `strip`. Προσθέτουμε τη λίστα αυτή στη συνολική λίστα κατηγοριών με την `extend`. Τέλος χρησιμοποιούμε πάλι την `np.unique` για να μετρήσουμε συχνότητα μοναδικών ετικετών κατηγοριών και ταξινομούμε με την `np.argsort`. Τυπώνουμε τις κατηγορίες και τις συχνότητες εμφάνισης ταξινομημένα. Χρήσιμες μπορεί να σας φανούν και οι `np.ravel`, `np.nditer`, `np.array2string` και `zip`.\n","\n","2. Ορίζουμε τη βασική μας συνάρτηση `print_cluster_neurons_movies_report` που δέχεται ως όρισμα τον αριθμό ενός cluster. Με τη χρήση της `np.where` μπορούμε να βρούμε τις συντεταγμένες των bmus που αντιστοιχούν στο cluster και με την `column_stack` να φτιάξουμε έναν πίνακα bmus για το cluster. Προσοχή στη σειρά (στήλη - σειρά) στον πίνακα bmus. Για κάθε bmu αυτού του πίνακα ελέγχουμε αν υπάρχει στον πίνακα μοναδικών bmus που έχουμε υπολογίσει στην αρχή συνολικά και αν ναι προσθέτουμε το αντίστοιχο index του νευρώνα σε μια λίστα. Χρήσιμες μπορεί να είναι και οι `np.rollaxis`, `np.append`, `np.asscalar`. Επίσης πιθανώς να πρέπει να υλοποιήσετε ένα κριτήριο ομοιότητας μεταξύ ενός bmu και ενός μοναδικού bmu από τον αρχικό πίνακα bmus.\n","\n","3. Υλοποιούμε μια βοηθητική συνάρτηση `neuron_movies_report`. Λαμβάνει ένα σύνολο νευρώνων από την `print_cluster_neurons_movies_report` και μέσω της `indices` φτιάχνει μια λίστα με το σύνολο ταινιών που ανήκουν σε αυτούς τους νευρώνες. Στο τέλος καλεί με αυτή τη λίστα την `print_categories_stats` που τυπώνει τις στατιστικές των κατηγοριών.\n","\n","Μπορείτε βέβαια να προσθέσετε οποιαδήποτε επιπλέον έξοδο σας βοηθάει.

Παρατηρήστε ποια σχέση υπάρχει μεταξύ αριθμού ταινιών στο final set, μεγέθους grid και ποιότητας U-matrix.\n","- Για το k του k-Means προσπαθήστε να προσεγγίζει σχετικά τα clusters του U-matrix (όπως είπαμε είναι διαφορετικοί μέθοδοι clustering). Μικρός αριθμός k δεν θα σέβεται τα όρια. Μεγάλος αριθμός θα δημιουργεί υπο-clusters εντός των clusters που φαίνονται στο U-matrix. Το τελευταίο δεν είναι απαραίτητα κακό, αλλά μεγαλώνει τον αριθμό clusters που πρέπει να αναλυθούν σημασιολογικά.\n","- Σε μικρούς χάρτες και με μικρά final sets δοκιμάστε διαφορετικές παραμέτρους για την εκπαίδευση του SOM. Σημειώστε τυχόν παραμέτρους που επηρεάζουν την ποιότητα του clustering για το dataset σας ώστε να τις εφαρμόσετε στους μεγάλους χάρτες.\n","- Κάποια τοπολογικά χαρακτηριστικά εμφανίζονται ήδη σε μικρούς χάρτες. Κάποια άλλα χρειάζονται μεγαλύτερους χάρτες. Δοκιμάστε μεγέθη 20x20, 25x25 ή και 30x30 και αντίστοιχη προσαρμογή των k. Όσο μεγαλώνουν οι χάρτες, μεγαλώνει η ανάλυση του χάρτη αλλά μεγαλώνει και ο αριθμός clusters που πρέπει να αναλυθούν.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"x4IUl8O8ayVf"},"source":["\n","\n","## Ανάλυση τοπολογικών ιδιοτήτων χάρτη SOM\n","\n","Μετά το πέρας της εκπαίδευσης και του clustering θα έχετε ένα χάρτη με τοπολογικές ιδιότητες ως προς τα είδη των ταίνιών της συλλογής σας, κάτι αντίστοιχο με την εικόνα στην αρχή της Εφαρμογής 2 αυτού του notebook (η συγκεκριμένη εικόνα είναι μόνο για εικονογράφιση, δεν έχει καμία σχέση με τη συλλογή δεδομένων και τις κατηγορίες μας).\n","\n","Για τον τελικό χάρτη SOM που θα παράξετε για τη συλλογή σας, αναλύστε σε markdown με συγκεκριμένη αναφορά σε αριθμούς clusters και τη σημασιολογική ερμηνεία τους τις εξής τρεις τοπολογικές ιδιότητες του SOM: \n","\n","1.
